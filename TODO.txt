Proof of Concept

Ziel: Technische umsetzbarkeit des Browsergame projekts

Technische Komponenten:
- Twitch Extension
- Containerisiertes Backend

- Twitch Bot + chat commands
- Datenbank MySQL

Gameplay Komponenten:
- Gebäude Bauen
- Resourcen Sammeln (auch aus gebäuden)
- Timer für Bau und Reisen
- Units Bauen
- Spieler

--------------------------

containerize it

- build api for community
-- create new community
-- select node
-- get community info
-- list players
-- get player

- build api for player
-- create new player
-- get resources
-- building api
--- build <building>
--- get building info
--- list buildings [<type>]

next up!!!
unit production
second player
basic combat
twitch extension (or other ui)

!!! check factory creation with objects like ResourceCollection (propably buildings)
events maybe with timeline based system, define event causing actions and keep a track in player. then evaluate from event to event which calculcation conditions apply
maybe look at stricter typing for resources
maybe replace json with pickle (native python stuff)

sqlalchemy does not persist change automaticaly for player building upgrade...dunno why
chatgpt chat about making changes known to sqlalchemy may help
manual approach works but well not nice to do that
